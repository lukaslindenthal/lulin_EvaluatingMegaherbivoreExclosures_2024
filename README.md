# Vegetation Sampling Project in Limpopo, South Africa

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the LELE vegetation survey in the Lapalala Wilderness Nature Resort in Limpopo region of South Africa. The objective is to test whether a set of 
8 reasarch area (blocks) can fundament as a effective landscape replicates of the sourounding savanna ecoystem. Therefore a number of 96 individual vegetation samplings - each 10m by 10m - was conducted  

The Limpopo region is a highly diverse ecological zone with significant environmental challenges such as deforestation and land-use changes, which makes it an ideal location for this research.

## Study Area
The study was conducted in the LWNR in Limpopo, SA. Tne Nature Resort is located in the northeastern part of South Africa within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve. This region is known for its rich biodiversity, varying climate zones, and distinct plant species that contribute to the ecological value of the area.

- **Coordinates**: lat -23.5889° ; long 28.3853°
- **Altitude**: Waterberg +830 to +2,085m above MSL
- **Climate**: The region experiences a semi-arid climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To assess the diversity of plant species within the different research blocks.
2. To examine the relationship between environmental variables (e.g., soil type, altitude) and plant distribution.
3. To establish a baseline for future studies on vegetation changes due to climate change or human activities.

## Methodology
### Sampling Technique
The vegetation sampling was conducted using **random stratified sampling** to ensure that all vegetation types are represented. Plots were established across different biomes to capture the diversity of species.

### Data Collection
Sampling took place in 2021, covering the main vegetation seasion from mid December to the end of March. 
The following data were collected:
- Species identification
- Plant density and abundance
- Elevation and slope measurements
- ...

## Data
  
Data is stored in **CSV format** and available in the project repository under the `data` folder.

## Results
Initial analysis of the data suggests:
.....

More detailed statistical analyses will be provided in subsequent reports.

## Conclusion
...


## Future Work
- Additional sampling will be conducted in the beginning of 2024.
- possible incorporating remote sensing data for large-scale vegetation mapping.

## Dependencies/Software
The following software and libraries were used in this project:
- **R** for data analysis and visualization
- **QGIS** for mapping and spatial analysis
- **Python** for data cleaning and manipulation (pandas, numpy)
